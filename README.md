# SecureBank: A Console-Based Banking Management System in C

The original prct.c program is designed to navigate and manage process trees on a Linux system by leveraging the /proc filesystem. It takes user inputs through command-line arguments and performs various tasks such as identifying process relationships (parent, child, sibling), checking statuses like zombie or orphan processes, and even sending signals to terminate or stop processes. While this is deeply rooted in operating system-level programming, the modular structure, input handling, and logical flow of the code make it highly adaptable for applications like a Console-Based Banking Management System in C.

The core similarity lies in the structure and design principles used in prct.c. The program uses a modular design, where each functionality (like listing children, checking status, or sending signals) is separated into its own function. This separation of concerns is ideal for banking systems as well. In a Banking Management System, you could define similar modular functions such as create_account(), deposit(), withdraw(), transfer_funds(), and check_balance(). Each of these functions would encapsulate a specific task, improving readability, reusability, and maintainability—just like prct.c.

Instead of relying on the /proc filesystem to read process data, a banking system would use files or structures to store and retrieve customer and transaction data. For example, each account could be represented by a structure with fields like account number, name, balance, and password. Data persistence can be achieved using file operations (fopen, fwrite, fread, etc.), replacing the directory reading and file parsing in /proc.

Input handling in prct.c is done through command-line arguments. In a banking system, this would be replaced by a menu-driven interface, where users are shown a list of available actions and prompted to choose one by entering a number. This interactive approach is more user-friendly for regular users, while the command-line format of prct.c is more suited for power users and administrators.

Error checking and validation are crucial in both systems. prct.c checks whether a process exists, whether it is a descendant of another, or whether an action is valid. Similarly, a banking system must verify if an account exists, if sufficient balance is available for a transaction, or if login credentials are correct. Robust error messages and graceful handling of invalid inputs enhance the user experience and system reliability in both cases.

The signal-sending logic in prct.c (e.g., kill(pid, SIGKILL)) can be metaphorically thought of as operations like closing or freezing an account in a banking context. While these are not system-level signals, the idea of taking decisive action based on user input is common in both applications.

In conclusion, while prct.c and a banking management system operate in different domains—system programming vs application programming—their architectural and programming practices overlap significantly. The structured, modular, input-driven approach used in prct.c provides a solid foundation for building a secure, reliable, and user-friendly console-based banking system in C. With appropriate data storage mechanisms and a well-designed user interface, the transition from system process management to banking operations becomes both logical and efficient.
